# Setting up Cross Chain Connection (ICON-ARCHWAY) using IBC Bridge

Follow these steps to establish a cross-chain connection between ICON and Archway using the IBC Bridge:

## Step 1: Ensure Kurtosis Engine is Running

Before proceeding, ensure that the Kurtosis Engine is running in the background. If it's not already running, start it with the following command:

```filename="" copy
kurtosis engine start
```

## Step 2:  Start Two Chains (ICON and Archway) with IBC Bridge

To start both the ICON and Archway chains and establish a IBC bridge between them, run the following command:

```filename="" copy
dive bridge ibc --chainA icon --chainB archway
```

Executing above command will generate 'services.json' in working directory which contains service details for the 'icon' and 'archway' chains.

The above command automates several essential tasks to configure and initialise the local environment:

- **Spinning up ICON and Archway Nodes:** DIVE automatically starts and configures the required ICON and Archway nodes for your local environment.

- **Installing Required npm Dependencies:** DIVE takes care of installing all the necessary npm dependencies for seamless operation.

- **Enabling IBC Block on ICON Local Network:** DIVE facilitates IBC block functionality on the ICON local network by registering the node as a P-Rep and decentralizing the network.

- **Deploying Contracts for IBC:** DIVE automatically builds and deploys essential smart contracts (ibc_core,light_client,xCall_ibc_connection,xCall & sample dApp) for IBC functionality on both ICON and Archway chains.

- **Starting the Relay:** The relay image is built and launched, actively monitoring both ICON and Archway chains to enable smooth message transfer between them.


## Step 3: Setup is completed
Once the process completes, your local environment with the ICON and Archway chains connected via the IBC bridge will be ready for testing and development.

DIVE CLI simplifies the entire setup, allowing you to focus on developing and testing your decentralized applications with ease. Happy developing
