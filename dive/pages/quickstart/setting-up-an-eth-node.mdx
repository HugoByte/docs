# Setting up an ETH Node

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up an Ethereum node using DIVE CLI. This process enables you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain on your local environment. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Ensure Kurtosis Engine is Running

Starting an Ethereum chain with DIVE CLI is a straightforward process. Before you proceed, make sure the Kurtosis Engine is running in the background. If it's not already running, start it with the following command:

```filename="" copy
kurtosis engine start
```
## Step 2:  Start Eth Chain

To start an single eth node, run the following command:

```filename="" copy
dive chain eth
```
Executing this command will generate 'services.json,' in working directory which contains service details for the 'eth' chain.

<details>
<summary>
services.json
</summary>

```filename="" copy
{
  "service_name": "el-1-geth-lighthouse",
  "endpoint_public": "http://172.16.0.3:8544",
  "endpoint": "http://172.16.0.5:8545",
  "keypassword": "password",
  "keystore_path": "keystores/eth_keystore.json",
  "network": "0x301824.eth",
  "network_name": "eth",
  "nid": "0x301824"
}
```
* <b>service_name:</b> The name of the service.
* <b>endpoint_public:</b> The public endpoint URL for interacting with the service.
* <b>endpoint:</b> The private endpoint.
* <b>keypassword:</b> The password used for accessing the service's keystore.
* <b>keystore_path:</b> The file path for the service's keystore.
* <b>network:</b> The network ID.
* <b>network_name:</b> The name of the network.
* <b>nid:</b> The unique identifier id for the network.  

</details>


## Step 3: Setup is completed

After running the command, DIVE CLI will automatically start the ETH node and handle the necessary initialization processes. Please wait for the ETH node to fully initialize, which may take a few moments.
Once the initialization is complete, you can interact with the local ETH chain as needed. DIVE CLI sets up the ETH node on your local environment, enabling you to deploy and test smart contracts, explore transactions, and experiment with various ICON blockchain features.

  *Tip:* DIVE cli also supports hardhat chain. You can start an hardhat chain by running the command - dive chain hardhat
