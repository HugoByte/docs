# Setting up a NEUTRON Node

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up a Neutron node using DIVE CLI. This process enables you to interact with the cosmos blockchain in your local environment. Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 1: Ensure Kurtosis Engine is Running

Starting a Neutron chain with DIVE CLI is a straightforward process. Before you proceed, make sure the Kurtosis Engine is running in the background. If it's not already running, start it with the following command:

```bash filename="" copy
kurtosis engine start
```

## Step 2: Start Neutron Chain

To start a Neutron node, you can use the following command:

```bash filename="" copy
dive chain neutron
```

Executing this command will generate 'services.json' in the working directory, which contains service details for the 'neutron' chain.

<details>
<summary>
services.json
</summary>

```json filename="" copy
{
  "service_name": "neutron-node",
  "endpoint_public": "http://127.0.0.1:26657",
  "endpoint": "http://172.16.0.3:26657"
}
```

- **service_name:** The name of the service.
- **endpoint_public:** The public endpoint URL for interacting with the service.
- **endpoint:** The endpoint for interacting with the service.
</details>


## Step 3: Start Neutron with Custom Configuration

You can start the Neutron node with custom public ports and a custom chain ID using the following command:

```bash filename="" copy
dive chain neutron -c /path/to/custom-config.json
```

Replace `/path/to/custom-config.json` with the actual file path to your custom configuration file. Here's an example of a custom configuration file:

<details>
<summary>
custom_config.json
</summary>

```json filename="" copy
{
  "chainId": "test-chain2",
  "key": "test-key",
  "password": "clock post desk civil pottery foster expand merit dash seminar song memory figure uniform spice circle try happy obvious trash crime hybrid hood cushion",
  "public_grpc": 8033,
  "public_tcp": 26634,
  "public_http": 1315,
  "public_rpc": 26696
}
```
In this example, we've set a custom chain ID, key, password, and custom public ports. Modify the values in the JSON file according to your requirements.
