# Setting up Cross Chain Connection (ICON-ETH) using BTP Bridge

Follow these steps to establish a cross-chain connection between ICON and Ethereum using the BTP Bridge:

## Step 1: Ensure Kurtosis Engine is Running

Before proceeding, ensure that the Kurtosis Engine is running in the background. If it's not already running, start it with the following command:

```filename="" copy
kurtosis engine start
```

## Step 2:  Start Two Chains (ICON and Ethereum/Hardhat) with BTP Bridge

To start both the ICON and Ethereum chains and establish a BTP bridge between them, run the following command:

```filename="" copy
dive bridge btp --chainA icon --chainB eth
```

Executing above command will generate 'dive.json' in working directory which contains service details for the 'icon' and 'eth' chains.

  *Tip:* By default, the bridge flag is set to false. If you need an ICON bridge, add the --bridge flag to the command.
</Callout>

The above command automates several essential tasks to configure and initialise the local environment:

- **Spinning up ICON and Ethereum Nodes:** DIVE automatically starts and configures the required ICON and Ethereum nodes for your local environment.

- **Installing Required npm Dependencies:** DIVE takes care of installing all the necessary npm dependencies for seamless operation.

- **Enabling BTP Block on ICON Local Network:** DIVE facilitates BTP block functionality on the ICON local network by registering the node as a P-Rep and decentralizing the network.

- **Deploying Contracts for BTP:** DIVE automatically builds and deploys essential smart contracts (BMC, BMV, xCall & sample dApp) for BTP functionality on both ICON and Ethereum chains.

- **Starting the Relay:** The relay image is built and launched, actively monitoring both ICON and Ethereum chains to enable smooth message transfer between them.


## Step 3: Setup is completed
Once the process completes, your local environment with the ICON and Ethereum chains connected via the BTP bridge will be ready for testing and development.

DIVE CLI simplifies the entire setup, allowing you to focus on developing and testing your decentralized applications with ease. Happy developing
